# Compiler

This project is a custom-built compiler in C designed to detect missing semicolons in code statements where theyâ€™re mandatory for correct execution. By reading and analyzing each line of a C file, the compiler determines whether a semicolon is needed based on a set of rules and notifies the user of any missing semicolons in real-time. This helps in preventing common syntax errors, saving developers time and improving code accuracy.
